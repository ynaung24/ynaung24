## 👋 Hello! Mingalarbar (မင်္ဂလာပါ)! 

I'm Yan, an AI Engineer and Data Scientist. I am originally from Yangon, Myanmar, but I've been in the US since 2017. I turn complex data into powerful AI solutions and draw causal inferences leveraging machine learning algorithms.

### 🔭 What I'm Mainly Working On:
- Building a **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed to handle **1000+ daily queries**.

### 🎯 My Passion Projects:
- Emotion detection model using **Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, and Large Language Models** to build a multi-modal ensemble model and provide a dashboard to visualize the results.
- Building a **Convolutional Neural Network** to blend the style of an art era and a photograph taken by the end-user.
- Building an AI Chatbot that can be personalized to mimic a user based on a corpus of information about the user leveraging RAG.

### 🤝 I'm Looking to Collaborate On:
- Projects involving NLP, Generative AI, or scalable ML systems
- Open-source initiatives related to AI tools and libraries
